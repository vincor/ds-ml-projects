    "3. The US Average Insurance Cost is growing with the growing BMI, but it is still near the Total Average Cost. We can say that the BMI parameter IS NOT the most influencing parameter. But we must add that if the BMI of the patient is less than 18.5 (Underweight group), the US Average Insurance Cost has a value of about USD 4600 less than the Total Average Cost, and this is already a notable difference.\n",
    "4. The US Average Insurance Costs calculated by the number of children are near the Total Average Cost. So we can say that the number of Children IS NOT the most influencing parameter. But we must add that if the patient has five children or more, the US Average Insurance Cost has a value of about USD 4500 less than the Total Average Cost, and this is already a notable difference.\n",

Also, The Average Cost of Non-Smoking patients is about USD4800 less than the Total Average Cost. So from the data given, we can definitely say that the Smoker parameter IS THE MOST influencing parameter.\n",
